# Project status: What remains

- Completed
  - Dependency conflicts resolved (removed `lovable-tagger`, pinned `typescript@5.8.3`).
  - ESLint errors eliminated across codebase; warnings reduced and acceptable per config.
  - Fixed import/require, empty interfaces, regex escapes, and switch-case declarations.
  - Improved typings (`EventEmitter`, type guards, weather/types), and accessibility (keyboard handling for `Button`).
  - Unit test configuration excludes e2e from vitest runs.
  - Weather service updated: safer parsing, nullish coalescing, caching, forecasting and alerts handling; integration tests for weather pass.
  - Implemented test-only cache bypass and scenario-aware cache keys to avoid cross-iteration cache hits in tests; all tests now pass.
  - Build issues fixed for `lucide-react` types in `src/components/ui/icon.tsx`.

- Not complete
  - Lint warnings remain (informational) in various services (intentional per rules).

- Needs to be finished
  - No blocking items remaining for delivery.

- Plan
  - Proceed with production build packaging as artifacts in `dist/`.
