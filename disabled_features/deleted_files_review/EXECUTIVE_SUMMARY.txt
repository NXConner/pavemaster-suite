# Component Analysis Summary

## Key Findings

1. **Button Component**: Original has 6+ variants vs our 3, uses CVA pattern - REPLACE IMMEDIATELY
2. **UI Components**: We're missing 40+ essential components (dialog, form, input, table, etc.) - CRITICAL GAP
3. **Error Handling**: No ErrorBoundary.tsx - PRODUCTION RISK
4. **Architecture**: Missing Layout.tsx, Dashboard.tsx - CORE INFRASTRUCTURE GAP

## Priority Actions

ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Restore ErrorBoundary, complete UI library, replace Button
ðŸ”´ HIGH: Restore Dashboard, Layout, core business components  
ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM: Upgrade Card/Tabs/Badge, restore analytics
ðŸŸ¢ LOW: Evaluate experimental features

## Security Files
- advancedSecurity.ts.disabled: Review before enabling
- gestureControl.ts.disabled: Low priority, experimental

## Bottom Line
Current components are basic placeholders. Original components are production-ready with advanced features. Immediate restoration needed for app stability and functionality.
