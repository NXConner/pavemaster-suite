# Deleted or Disabled Files

This folder contains all files that have been deleted or disabled from the main project. Files are organized by category and date of removal.

## Structure

- `deleted_files_review/` - Previously moved files from merge conflicts
- `infrastructure/` - Infrastructure and deployment related files
- `src/components/` - React components that were removed
- `src/components/ui/` - UI component library files

## Why Files Are Here

Files may be moved here for various reasons:
- Build errors that need fixing
- Functionality that's not currently needed
- Components that conflict with current implementation
- Files that need refactoring before re-integration

## Restoring Files

To restore a file:
1. Copy the file back to its original location in the main project
2. Fix any import/dependency issues
3. Ensure it follows current project standards
4. Test thoroughly before committing
