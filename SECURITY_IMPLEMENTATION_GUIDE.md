# Security Implementation Guide
## Critical Security Fixes for PaveMaster Suite

This guide outlines the remaining security fixes needed after the database migration.

## âœ… COMPLETED FIXES

### Database Security
- âœ… **Function Search Path Protection**: All 9 functions now have secure `search_path` settings
- âœ… **Role Escalation Protection**: Added trigger to prevent users from modifying their own roles
- âœ… **Enhanced Security Logging**: Implemented comprehensive audit logging
- âœ… **Rate Limiting Infrastructure**: Created rate limiting tables and functions
- âœ… **RLS Enabled**: All tables now have Row Level Security enabled

### Application Security
- âœ… **Enhanced Input Sanitization**: Improved XSS protection in security utilities
- âœ… **Environment Configuration**: Updated .env.example with secure defaults

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL MANUAL FIXES REQUIRED

### 1. Authentication Configuration (HIGH PRIORITY)
Navigate to your Supabase Dashboard â†’ Authentication â†’ Settings:

**OTP Settings:**
- Current: OTP expiry = 1 hour (TOO LONG)
- Required: Change to 5 minutes maximum
- Location: Auth â†’ Settings â†’ Auth â†’ OTP expiry time

**Password Protection:**
- Current: Leaked password protection = DISABLED
- Required: Enable leaked password protection
- Location: Auth â†’ Settings â†’ Auth â†’ Password strength

### 2. Database Policies (HIGH PRIORITY)
You still have 15 tables with RLS enabled but no policies. Run this query to identify them:

```sql
SELECT schemaname, tablename 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND tablename NOT IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT tablename 
  FROM pg_policies 
  WHERE schemaname = 'public'
)
AND tablename NOT IN ('spatial_ref_sys');
```

**Required Action:** Create appropriate RLS policies for each table based on your business logic.

### 3. Database Extensions (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
Two extensions are in the public schema (security warning):
- Review and potentially move extensions to a different schema
- Check if these extensions are necessary for your application

### 4. Environment Variables (HIGH PRIORITY)
Replace all placeholder values in your `.env` file:

```bash
# Generate secure keys
openssl rand -hex 32  # For VITE_ENCRYPTION_KEY
openssl rand -base64 64  # For VITE_JWT_SECRET
```

## ðŸ“‹ VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

### Immediate Actions (Next 24 hours)
- [ ] Change OTP expiry to 5 minutes in Supabase Dashboard
- [ ] Enable leaked password protection in Supabase Dashboard
- [ ] Replace all placeholder environment variables
- [ ] Create RLS policies for remaining 15 tables
- [ ] Test authentication flows with new settings

### Short-term Actions (Next week)
- [ ] Implement Content Security Policy headers
- [ ] Set up security monitoring and alerts
- [ ] Conduct penetration testing on auth flows
- [ ] Document security procedures for team

### Ongoing Actions
- [ ] Regular security audits (monthly)
- [ ] Environment variable rotation (quarterly)
- [ ] Dependency vulnerability scanning (weekly)
- [ ] Security training for development team

## ðŸ”§ DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### Before Deploying to Production
1. Run `lov-supabase-linter` to check for security issues
2. Verify all environment variables are production-ready
3. Test authentication with rate limiting enabled
4. Confirm all RLS policies are working correctly
5. Run security scan on the application

### Security Monitoring
- Set up alerts for failed login attempts
- Monitor for unusual database access patterns
- Track and review security audit logs regularly
- Implement automated security scanning in CI/CD

## ðŸ“ž SUPPORT

If you encounter issues with any of these security fixes:
1. Check the Supabase documentation links provided in the linter output
2. Review the implementation in this guide
3. Test in a development environment first
4. Monitor logs for any authentication issues

## ðŸŽ¯ NEXT STEPS

1. **Immediate**: Fix authentication settings in Supabase Dashboard
2. **Phase 2**: Create remaining RLS policies
3. **Phase 3**: Implement production monitoring
4. **Phase 4**: Security training and documentation

Remember: Security is an ongoing process, not a one-time setup!
