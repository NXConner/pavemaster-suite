- Performance regression tests
- Security penetration tests

#### 2. Error Handling & Logging Enhancement

```typescript
// Centralized error handling
class ErrorHandler {
  static handleApiError(error: ApiError): void {
    // Log to monitoring service
    console.error('API Error:', error);
    // Show user-friendly message
    toast.error(this.getUserFriendlyMessage(error));
    // Track for analytics
    analytics.track('error_occurred', error);
  }
}
```

#### 3. Type Safety Improvements

```typescript
// Enhanced type definitions
interface StrictProjectType {
  readonly id: string;
  readonly createdAt: Date;
  readonly updatedAt: Date;
  status: ProjectStatus;
  details: ProjectDetails;
  // Prevent runtime errors with strict typing
}
```

### Performance Optimizations

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_projects_status_date 
ON projects(status, created_at DESC);

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_equipment_location 
ON equipment USING GIST(location);
```

#### 2. Frontend Performance
```typescript
// Virtual scrolling for large lists
import { FixedSizeList as List } from 'react-window';

// Memoization for expensive calculations
const ExpensiveComponent = memo(({ data }) => {
  const calculatedValue = useMemo(() => 
    heavyCalculation(data), [data]
  );
  return <div>{calculatedValue}</div>;
});
```

#### 3. Caching Strategy

// Multi-level caching
const cacheConfig = {
  browser: {
    maxAge: 3600, // 1 hour
    staleWhileRevalidate: 86400 // 24 hours
  },
  cdn: {
    maxAge: 31536000, // 1 year for static assets
    immutable: true
  },
  api: {
    maxAge: 300, // 5 minutes for dynamic data
